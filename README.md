# Transcriptomics course
I devloped and taught this course at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/) in 2018. The course is designed for bio/life science researchers who need to understand how to analyze public or their own RNA-seq data to achieve functional annotation of genes. The focus is on the end-to-end process and flow of data during the process.

## Contents
There are 5 lecture slide decks in `lectures` and 5 lab exercise sets in `labs`. The topics include:
- Linux basics
- *De novo* transcriptome assembly
- Transcriptome functional annotation
- Differential expression analysis
- Functional annotation data mining
